## questions

**Q1:** Please assign values to five different variables each corresponding to a different simple data type /
that exist in the Python language. Please pay attention for the PEP8 guidelines in choosing variable names!

**Q2:** Assign variables to the individual components of your favourite gene (e.g promoter, 5' UTR, start codon, /
 exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3' UTR). Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator /
 on the standard output! Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by randomly filling in the components.
